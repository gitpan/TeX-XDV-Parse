TeX::XDV::Parse version 0.04
============================

DESCRIPTION
    TeX::XDV::Parse is an extension of TeX::DVI::Parse, much as XDV is an
    extension of DVI. This module simply overlays the additional XDV
    functionality on top of TeX::DVI::Parse and inherits its interface.

    To use, you should subclass this module and define functions to handle
    each of the XDV/DVI commands. Each command will be passed the
    appropriate arguments. For example:

      sub dir {
        my ($self, $opcode, $direction) = @_;
        ...
      }

    The additional XDV commands are dir, glyph_string, glyph_array,
    pic_file, and native_font_def. Optionally, the XDV flag constants are
    also available for import.

    An example module, TeX::XDV::Print, is available in the source
    distribution package under the inc directory.

    See the TeX::DVI::Parse documentation for details on the DVI commands.
