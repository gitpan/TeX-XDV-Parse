TeX-XDV-Parse version 0.02
==========================

    TeX::XDV::Parse is an extension of TeX::DVI::Parse, much as XDV is an
    extension of DVI. This module simply overlays the additional XDV
    functionality on top of TeX::DVI::Parse and inherits its interface.

    To use, you should subclass this module and define functions to handle
    each of the XDV/DVI commands. Each command will be passed the
    appropriate arguments. For example:

    sub dir {

    my ($self, $opcode, $direction) = @_;

    ...

    }

    See the TeX::DVI::Parse documentation for details on the DVI commands.
